## Description
Astral Peril is an exhilarating space adventure where you control a UFO (alien) on a mission to reach Earth. Navigate through asteroid obstacles and dodge bullets fired by Earth's defenses. The defense system employs a sophisticated Lagrange Extrapolation method, capable of considering 10 or more data points to accurately target the UFO.
